# FACCHA
Fast Automated Captcha Cracker to Help Automation

### What is FACCHA?
FACCHA is an open source software which tries to break text captchas (and some time later maybe also "Image Captchas").
FACCHA is not optimized for any particular cpatcha type and is developed with the idea "Keep it as general as possible" in mind.

### How to use it?
Just download the latest *.zip file (only for windows) and Drag & Drop the captcha to analyze on it (or alternative execute the software via cmd).
If you are using Linux you have to recompile it, however there is an (untested) makefile available in "src" folder.
